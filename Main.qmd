# Types of Goods (01/08)

## Characteristics of the Four Types of Goods
- **Rivalrous** goods are those that can only be consumed by one person at a time. 
- **Non-rivalrous** goods are those that can be consumed by multiple people at the same time.
- **Excludable** goods are those that can be restricted to certain people.
- **Non-excludable** goods are those that cannot be restricted to certain people.
- If a public good is overcrowded enough, it can become a common resource

# Introduction to Externalities (01/09-01/10)

## Overview
- An **externality** is a cost/benefit that affects a *third party* who did not choose to incur that cost/benefit.
- They are a type of **market failure** because they are *not* accounted for in the price of the good/service.
- The deadweight loss (DWL) of positive externalities will point to the right and vice-versa for negative externalities.
  - Which means the DWL triangle always points to the social optimum quantity.

## Internalizing an Externality (aka *how to fix an externality*)

### Problems with externalities
1) Private individuals won't take into account the external costs/benefits
2) Public goods and common pool resources tend to lack property rights

### Coase Theorem (the fix!)
"We can fix externalities without the government if we..."

1) Give property rights to people
2) Minimize transaction costs

### Examples
Methods the government can employ to internalize an externality in a free market:

- Pollution or emission limits
- "Pollution credits" for private firms to buy and sell in the market

## Positive Externality in Consumption
![Positive Externality in Consumption](img/pos-cons.png){width=50%}

### Examples
- Consumption of education
- Consumption of health care
- Advertisement can lead to an increase of demand in the free market $\therefore MPB$ goes up and moves the market toward $MSB$.

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MEB = MSB-MPB$.
- $MPB < MSB$
- $MPC = MSC$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **benefits** can be internalized by **subsidizing** the product/service to the consumers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Negative Externality in Consumption
![Negative Externality in Consumption](img/neg-cons.png){width=45%}

### Examples
- Smoking in public/passive smoking
- Pollution due to fossil fuels
- Playing loud music
- Discarding garbage in public places

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MEB = MSB-MPB$.
- $MPB > MSB$
- $MPC = MSC$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **benefits** can be internalized by **imposing a tax** on the product/service to the consumers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.

## Positive Externality in Production
![Positive Externality in Production](img/pos-prod.png){width=50%}

### Examples 
- Companies invest in training/professional development of their employees.
- Firms invest in research and development (R&D).

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MEC = MSC-MPC$.
- $MPB = MSB$
- $MPC > MSC$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **costs** can be internalized by **subsidizing** the product/service to the producers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Negative Externality in Production
![Negative Externality in Production](img/neg-prod.png){width=50%}

### Examples
- Firms produce chemicals that cause pollution $\therefore$ local fisherman cannot catch fish.
- Construction of roads lead to change of landscape and parks
- Coal fired power plants

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MEC = MSC-MPC$.
- $MPB = MSB$
- $MPC < MSC$


### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **costs** can be internalized by **imposing a tax** on the product/service to the producers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.

# Income Inequality (01/12)

## The Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient
- The **Lorenz Curve** $L(x)$ is a graphical representation of the distribution of income in a country.
  - The x-axis is the cumulative percentage of the population (0%-100%).
  - The y-axis is the cumulative percentage of income (0%-100%).
  - It is always accompanied by the line $y=x$ which represents **perfect equality**.
- The **Gini Coefficient** $G$ is a numerical representation of the Lorenz Curve.
  - It is the ratio of the area between the Lorenz Curve and the line $y=x$ to the area under the line $y=x$.
    - $G = \frac{A}{A+B}$ where $A = \int_{0}^{1} \left[x-L(x)\right] \ \mathrm{d}x$ and $B = \int_{0}^{1}L(x) \ \mathrm{d}x$.
  - The closer $G$ is to 1, the more unequal the distribution of income is.

![Visual depiction of the Lorenz Curve](img/lorenz.png){width=68%}

As demonstrated in *Figure 6* below:

- If $G$ is 0, then the Lorenz Curve is **also** the line $y=x$ because the area between both curves $A$ is 0.
- If $G$ is 1, then the Lorenz Curve is the x-axis ($y=0$) because $A+B$ must also equal the area under $y=x$, or $\frac{1}{2}$.

![Varying Gini Coefficients and their corresponding Lorenz Curves](img/varying-gini.png){width=100%}

## Deriving Simpler Expressions for the Gini Coefficient
Since we know that $A+B = \int_{0}^{1} x \ \mathrm{d}x = \left.\frac{x^2}{2}\right\vert_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{2}$, we can derive "easier" expressions to calculate the Gini Coefficient $G$.

### Deriving $G=2A$
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
G &= \frac{A}{A+B}\tag{Initial Gini Coefficient formula} \\
\frac{1}{G} &= \frac{A+B}{A}\tag{Reciprocate} \\
\frac{A}{G} &= A+B\tag{Multiply by $A$} \\
\frac{A}{G}-A &= B\tag{Subtract $A$}
\end{align}
```
{{< pagebreak >}}

Now we can substitute $B$ into the original area formula:
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
A + B &= \frac{1}{2}\tag{Area under $y=x$} \\
A+\left(\frac{A}{G}-A\right) &= \frac{1}{2}\tag{Substitute $B$} \\
\frac{A}{G} &= \frac{1}{2}\tag{Simplify} \\
\cfrac{A}{\frac{1}{2}} &= G\tag{Simplify} \\
2A &= G\tag{Multiply by 2}
\end{align}
```

### Deriving $G=1-2B$
Since we've already expressed $B$ in terms of $A$, we just need to get $A$ in terms of $B$.
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
G = 2A \tag{Previous derivation} \\
\frac{G}{2} = A \tag{Divide by 2} \\
\frac{G}{2} = \frac{1}{2}-B\tag{Substitute $A$ using the expression $A=\frac{1}{2}-B$} \\
G = 1-2B\tag{Multiply by 2}
\end{align}
```
Therefore, two **alternate expressions** for the Gini Coefficient are:
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
G &= 2A \\
G &= 1-2B
\end{align}
```

## Negative Externalities: Public vs. Private Resolution and More on the Coase Theorem (01/16)

### Conditions
Recall that the **Coase Theorem** states market failures will always be resolved by the free market. Here are all the conditions for Coase Theorem to hold true:

- Both sides are rational and willing to negotiate tomaximize their own utility.
- Low to no transaction cost
- Private property rights are well defined
- Perfect information is available to both sides and they have the same leverage

### Miscellaneous Market Failures
- **Monopoly**: A single firm controls the entire market.
  - This will cause the firm to produce *less* than the social optimum at a *greater price*.
- **Monopsony**: A single firm controls the entire labor market.
  - This will cause the firm to hire *less* than optimum and for a *lower wage*.
