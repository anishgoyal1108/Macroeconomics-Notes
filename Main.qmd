# Types of Goods (01/08)

## Characteristics of the Four Types of Goods
- **Rivalrous** goods are those that can only be consumed by one person at a time. 
- **Non-rivalrous** goods are those that can be consumed by multiple people at the same time.
- **Excludable** goods are those that can be restricted to certain people.
- **Non-excludable** goods are those that cannot be restricted to certain people.
- If a public good is overcrowded enough, it can become a common resource

# Introduction to Externalities (01/09-01/10)

## Overview
- An **externality** is a cost/benefit that affects a *third party* who did not choose to incur that cost/benefit.
- They are a type of **market failure** because they are *not* accounted for in the price of the good/service.
- The deadweight loss (DWL) of positive externalities will point to the right and vice-versa for negative externalities.
  - Which means the DWL triangle always points to the social optimum quantity.

## Internalizing an Externality (aka *how to fix an externality*)

### Problems with externalities
1) Private individuals won't take into account the external costs/benefits
2) Public goods and common pool resources tend to lack property rights

### Coase Theorem (the fix!)
"We can fix externalities without the government if we..."

1) Give property rights to people
2) Minimize transaction costs

### Examples
Methods the government can employ to internalize an externality in a free market:

- Pollution or emission limits
- "Pollution credits" for private firms to buy and sell in the market

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Positive Externality in Consumption
![Positive Externality in Consumption](img/pos-cons.png){width=50%}

### Examples
- Consumption of education
- Consumption of health care
- Advertisement can lead to an increase of demand in the free market $\therefore MPB$ goes up and moves the market toward $MSB$.

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MEB = MSB-MPB$.
- $MPB < MSB$
- $MPC = MSC$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **benefits** can be internalized by **subsidizing** the product/service to the consumers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Negative Externality in Consumption
![Negative Externality in Consumption](img/neg-cons.png){width=45%}

### Examples
- Smoking in public/passive smoking
- Pollution due to fossil fuels
- Playing loud music
- Discarding garbage in public places

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MEB = MSB-MPB$.
- $MPB > MSB$
- $MPC = MSC$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **benefits** can be internalized by **imposing a tax** on the product/service to the consumers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Positive Externality in Production
![Positive Externality in Production](img/pos-prod.png){width=50%}

### Examples 
- Companies invest in training/professional development of their employees.
- Firms invest in research and development (R&D).

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MEC = MSC-MPC$.
- $MPB = MSB$
- $MPC > MSC$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **costs** can be internalized by **subsidizing** the product/service to the producers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Negative Externality in Production
![Negative Externality in Production](img/neg-prod.png){width=50%}

### Examples
- Firms produce chemicals that cause pollution $\therefore$ local fisherman cannot catch fish.
- Construction of roads lead to change of landscape and parks
- Coal fired power plants

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MEC = MSC-MPC$.
- $MPB = MSB$
- $MPC < MSC$


### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **costs** can be internalized by **imposing a tax** on the product/service to the producers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.

# Income Inequality (01/12)

## The Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient
- The **Lorenz Curve** $L(x)$ is a graphical representation of the distribution of income in a country.
  - The x-axis is the cumulative percentage of the population (0%-100%).
  - The y-axis is the cumulative percentage of income (0%-100%).
  - It is always accompanied by the line $y=x$ which represents **perfect equality**.
- The **Gini Coefficient** $G$ is a numerical representation of the Lorenz Curve.
  - It is the ratio of the area between the Lorenz Curve and the line $y=x$ to the area under the line $y=x$.
    - $G = \frac{A}{A+B}$ where $A = \int_{0}^{1} \left[x-L(x)\right] \ \mathrm{d}x$ and $B = \int_{0}^{1}L(x) \ \mathrm{d}x$.
  - The closer $G$ is to 1, the more unequal the distribution of income is.

![Visual depiction of the Lorenz Curve](img/lorenz.png){width=68%}

As demonstrated in *Figure 6* below:

- If $G$ is 0, then the Lorenz Curve is **also** the line $y=x$ because the area between both curves $A$ is 0.
- If $G$ is 1, then the Lorenz Curve is the x-axis ($y=0$) because $A+B$ must also equal the area under $y=x$, or $\frac{1}{2}$.

![Varying Gini Coefficients and their corresponding Lorenz Curves](img/varying-gini.png){width=100%}

## Deriving Simpler Expressions for the Gini Coefficient
Since we know that $A+B = \int_{0}^{1} x \ \mathrm{d}x = \left.\frac{x^2}{2}\right\vert_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{2}$, we can derive "easier" expressions to calculate the Gini Coefficient $G$.

### Deriving $G=2A$
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
G &= \frac{A}{A+B}\tag{Initial Gini Coefficient formula} \\
\frac{1}{G} &= \frac{A+B}{A}\tag{Reciprocate} \\
\frac{A}{G} &= A+B\tag{Multiply by $A$} \\
\frac{A}{G}-A &= B\tag{Subtract $A$}
\end{align}
```
{{< pagebreak >}}

Now we can substitute $B$ into the original area formula:
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
A + B &= \frac{1}{2}\tag{Area under $y=x$} \\
A+\left(\frac{A}{G}-A\right) &= \frac{1}{2}\tag{Substitute $B$} \\
\frac{A}{G} &= \frac{1}{2}\tag{Simplify} \\
\cfrac{A}{\frac{1}{2}} &= G\tag{Simplify} \\
2A &= G\tag{Multiply by 2}
\end{align}
```

### Deriving $G=1-2B$
Since we've already expressed $B$ in terms of $A$, we just need to get $A$ in terms of $B$.
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
G = 2A \tag{Previous derivation} \\
\frac{G}{2} = A \tag{Divide by 2} \\
\frac{G}{2} = \frac{1}{2}-B\tag{Substitute $A$ using the expression $A=\frac{1}{2}-B$} \\
G = 1-2B\tag{Multiply by 2}
\end{align}
```
Therefore, two **alternate expressions** for the Gini Coefficient are:
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
G &= 2A \\
G &= 1-2B
\end{align}
```

# Negative Externalities: Public vs. Private Resolution and More on the Coase Theorem (01/16)

## Conditions
Recall that the **Coase Theorem** states market failures will always be resolved by the free market. Here are all the conditions for Coase Theorem to hold true:

- Both sides are rational and willing to negotiate to maximize their own utility.
- Low to no transaction costs
- Private property rights are well-defined
- Perfect information is available to both sides and they have the same leverage

## Miscellaneous Market Failures
There are a couple of other market failures that the government should try to combat, based on the types of markets we learned about *in previous units*:

- **Monopoly**: A single firm controls the entire market.
  - This will cause the firm to produce *less* than the social optimum and still charge a *greater price*.
- **Monopsony**: A single firm controls the entire labor market.
  - This will cause the firm to hire *less* than optimum and for a *lower wage*.

# Intro to Macronomic Indicators (01/22-01/23)
GDP stands for **Gross Domestic Product.** Those three words are important to understand:

- Gross: Not just profits - *total* value
- Domestic: Made WITHIN the borders of the US 
- Products: Goods and services which have been produced 

Formal definition of GDP: \ 
**GDP** is: the sum of the market value of all final goods and services produced within the United States in a given time period (usually a year).

|   Concept    |                         Is                          |                   Is NOT                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Sum          | TOTAL                                               | Single industry or market                  |
| Value        | Based on the market price of the goods and services | subjective                                 |
| Final        | new and complete goods and services; ready for use  | intermediate goods/services; used goods    |
| G&S          | ONLY a good or service                              | FINANCIAL ASSETS (Stock/Bonds/ETFs/Crypto) |
| Produced     | MADE                                                | transfer payments or foreign aid           |
| Domestically | WITHIN US borders                                   | US citizens abroad                         |
| Time         | This year (NEW production)                          | OLD G&S, Goodwill                          |

## Calculating GDP
GDP is known as tam easure of *national income accounting*. What are the two accounting techniques used in measuring GDP?

- **Expenditure Approach**: Measures GDP by adding up all the spending on final goods and services produced in the nation during the year.
  - $GDP = C + I + G + (X-M)$; C=Consumption, I=Investment, G=Government Spending, X=Exports, M=Imports
- **Income Approach**: Measures GDP by adding up all the income earned by the factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship) during the year.
  - $GDP = W + I + R + P$; W=Wages, I=Interest, R=Rents, P=Profits
- Therefore, $GDP = C + I + G + (X-M) = W + I + R + P$

## Circular Flow Model and Leakages
![Circular Flow Model](img/circular-flow.png){width=75%}

- **Leakages** are the non-consumption uses of income, such as savings, taxes, and imports.
- Your piggy bank and transfer payments are leakages.

## Gross National Product
- **GNP** is the sum of the value of all final goods and services prodced by Americans anywhere in the world during a time period.

- A Social Security check from the government to a retired store clerk $\times$
- **An increase in business inventories**
- **The government's purchase of a new submarine for the Navy**

### We count only the final price of a good or service in GDP. Why?
We don't count intermediate and used goods/services because then we would be **double-counting**; also, the good/service in question might have not been made in the time period analyzed if it wasn't final.

### A purely financial transaction will not be counted in GDP. Why?
Because a purely financial transaction doesn't involve consumption, investment, government spending, exports, or imports.

### When a home-owner does home-improvement work, the labor is not counted in GDP. Why?
They're not paying themself or making any profits off of their work to contribute to the income approach for calculating GDP.

## Calculating GDP Examples (I didn't finish this)

### Example 1
Suppose that personal income is \$500 billion, personal taxes are \$100 billion, and depreciation is \$50 billion. Disposable income is equal to which of the following?

$DI = PT - PT = 100 - 50 = \$50 \text{ billion}$

### My Practice
Suppose that personal income is \$100 billion, personal taxes are \$50 billion, and depreciation is \$25 billion. Disposable income is equal to which of the following?

### Example 2
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Wages                       | \$50 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Rent                        | \$20 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Private Investment Spending | \$10 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Exports                     | \$30 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Interest Payments           | \$40 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| HH Profit                   | \$80 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+

What is the GDP? 
$GDP = W + R + I + X + P = 50 + 20 + 10 + 30 + 80 = \$190 \text{ billion}$

### My Practice
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Wages                       | \$90 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Rent                        | \$40 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Private Investment Spending | \$10 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Corporate Taxes             | \$50 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Interest Payments           | \$100 Billion |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| HH Profit                   | \$90 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+

What is the GDP? 
$GDP = W + R + I + X + P = 90 + 40 + 10 + 0 + 90 = \$230 \text{ billion}$

### Example 3
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Consumption Spending        | \$50 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Individual Income Taxes     | \$20 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Private Investment Spending | \$10 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Corporate Taxes             | \$20 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Exports                     | \$30 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Imports                     | \$40 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+
| Government Purchases        | \$80 Billion |
+-----------------------------+--------------+

What is the GDP?

### My Practice
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Consumption Spending        | \$70 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| State Income Taxes          | \$10 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Private Investment Spending | \$50 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Corporate Taxes             | \$80 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Net Exports                 | -\$40 Billion |
+-----------------------------+---------------+
| Government Purchases        | \$50 Billion  |
+-----------------------------+---------------+

What is the GDP?

Using the prior table and the expenditure approach, what percent of GDP is comprised of consumption, investment, and government spending?

How is this possible?

If a firm experiences depreciation of factor resources, which component of GDP is negatively affected?

### Example 4
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Aggregate Data        | Value (Billions) |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Consumption Spending  | 10               |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Employee Compensation | 7                |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Government Spending   | 60               |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Interest Payments     | 10               |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Net Exports           | -50              |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Profits               | 5                |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Rents                 | 5                |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Savings               | 10               |
+-----------------------+------------------+

Calculate GDP using both approaches.

Do both approaches yield equal GDP values? Why or why not?

### My Practice

+-----------------------+------------------+
| Aggregate Data        | Value (Billions) |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Consumption Spending  | 190              |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Employee Compensation | 200              |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Government Spending   | 100              |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Interest Payments     | 100              |
+-----------------------+------------------+
| Investment Spending   | 90               |

Calculate GDP using both approaches.

Do both approaches yield equal GDP values? Why or why not?

### Example 5
A country consists of 2 firms. Firm A's total revenue is \$200 million. The cost of their inputs is \$50 million. Firm B's total revenue is \$100 million. The cost of their inputs is \$10 million. What is the total value added in this economy?

### My Practice
+------------------------+--------+--------+--------+
| Kingdom of Burbonia    | Firm A | Firm B | Firm C |
+------------------------+--------+--------+--------+
| Firm's Sales           | 20     | 50     | 100    |
+------------------------+--------+--------+--------+
| Cost of Intermediate \ | 10 \   | 40 \   | 40 \   |
| Goods Purchased by \   | \      | \      | \      |
| Each firm              |        |        |        |
+------------------------+--------+--------+--------+

What is the total value added in the Kingdom of Burbonia, measured in millions of dollars?

### Challenge Problem
Consumption is one third of total GDP. Gross Private Investment Spending and Government Spending, Combined, are equal to consumption spending. Exports are twice the number of imports. Imports are $50 million. Government spending is four times as much as investment.

What is consumption spending?


What is investment spending?


What is government spending?


What are exports?


What is GDP?

# Advanced GDP Calculations (01/25)

## NGDP vs. RGDP

### If we want to measure the amount of production using current prices, what economic measure should we use?
Nominal GDP

### If we want to measure the amount of production using base year prices, what economic measure should we use?
Real GDP

### Define "REAL"
Accounting for inflation by referencing some initial level of price.

### What does RGDP show?
The measure of true product, accounting for inflation

### What are the formulas for types of GDP?
|       Nominal GDP        |                Real GDP                |
| :----------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| $\Sigma (Q_c \cdot P_c)$ | $\Sigma (Q_c \cdot P_{c,\text{base}})$ |


### Growth rate (percent change) formula:
$\frac{\text{New GDP}-\text{Old GDP}}{\text{Old GDP}} \cdot 100\%$

For the base year, the RGDP always equals the NGDP.

### Standard of living
- We use RGDP to measure the standard of living because it accounts for inflation.
- RGDP per capita is the best measure of standard of living.

### Inflation/Deflation
- $\frac{NGDP}{RGDP} \cdot 100\%$ is the deflator value ($DF$).
- If $DF > 100\%$ ($NGDP > RGDP$), there is inflation. 
- If $DF < 100\%$ ($NGDP < RGDP$), there is deflation.
- If $DF = 100\%$ ($NGDP = RGDP$), prices are staying the same.
- Disinflation is when the rate of inflation is decreasing, but inflation is still occurring nonetheless.
- The deflator is always 100\% in the base year.

### What limitations does GDP have as an economic measure?
- It doesn't account for non-market production (e.g. stay-at-home parents)
- It doesn't account for the underground economy (e.g. drug dealers)
- It doesn't account for negative externalities (e.g. pollution)

# Unemployment (01/29)

## Questions on introductory unemployment terms
1. Who constitutes as being employed?

If they worked full or part time during the past week or is on vacation or sick leave from a regular job.

2. Who constitutes as being unemployed?

If they did not work during the preceding week but made some effort to find work in the past four weeks.

3. Who constitutes as being out of the labor force?

People who are not employed and haven't looked for a job in four weeks. Institutionalized (prison), military, and those younger than 16 as well. Discouraged workers, full time students, unpaid homemakers, and retirees are examples.

4. Who constitutes a discouraged worker? Do they cause an underestimate or overestimate of the unemployment rate?

Workers tha thave given up looking ofr a job, now considered out of the labor force.

5. Is the entire population considered for unemployment calculations?

Only adults (16+), non-institutionalized, civilian, nonretired population.

## Types of unemployment

**Frictional unemployment**

- Unemployment that is initiated by workers themselves, who are in between jobs.
- "You quit your job and are looking for a new one"

**Structural unemployment**

- When the firm doesn't need the worker anymore
- "Your skills are no longer needed"
- This could indicate a displacement of workers by technology

**Cyclical unemployment**

- Unemployment that is caused by a recession
- "Your skills are still needed, but the economy is not doing well"

## Unemployment calculations

1. Total Population:

18+9+2+1 = 30

2. Total Adult Working-Age Population

18+9+2 = 29

3. Total Employed

18

4. Total Unemployed

9

5. Total Labor Force:

$EM+UE = 18+9=27$

Finding the three important rates

Note: $ER + UR = 100\%$

1. Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR):

$\frac{LF}{TAWAP} \cdot 100\% = \frac{27}{29} \cdot 100\% = 93.1\%$

2. Employment Rate (ER)

$\frac{EM}{LF} = \frac{EM}{EM+UE} \cdot 100\% = \frac{18}{27} \cdot 100\% = 66.7\%$

3. Unemployment Rate (UR)

$\frac{UE}{LF} = \frac{UE}{(EM+UE)} = \frac{9}{27} = 33.3\%$ 

## The Flow Problem
Day 1: Country of Burbonia has 10 citizens. All citizens are of the working-age population. 3 are UE. 1 is Discouraged. 6 are EM.

ER: 67.66\%, UR: 33.33\%, LFPR: 90\%

Day 2: One worker loses  their job to the machine, but they continue to look for employment.

- 4 UE, 1 Discouraged, 5 EM
- ER: 55.56\%, UR: 44.44\%, LFPR: 90\%
- ER: Decreases, UR: Increases, LFPR: Stays the same

Day 3: One unemployed laborer becomes discouraged.

- 3 UE, 2 Discouraged, 5 EM
- ER: 62.5\%, UR: 37.5\%, LFPR: 80\%
- ER: Increases, UR: Decreases, LFPR: Decreases

Day 4: One discouraged worker starts looking for a job, but there are no available positions.

- 4 UE, 1 Discouraged, 5 EM
- ER: 55.56\%, UR: 44.44\%, LFPR: 90\%
- ER: Decreases, UR: Increases, LFPR: Increases

Day 5: Another discouraged worker finds a new job and starts working immediately.

- 4 UE, 0 Discouraged, 6 EM
- ER: 60\%, UR: 40\%, LFPR: 100\%
- ER: Increases, UR: Decreases, LFPR: Increases

## CPI
The **CPI** (consumer price index) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. 

- The 8 major groups of the CPI
  - Food and beverages
  - Housing
  - Apparel
  - Transportation
  - Medical care
  - Recreation
  - Education and communication
  - Other goods and services
- It **does not include** life insurance, social security, or income taxes.
- The core CPI is the CPI excluding food and energy prices.

## Calculating CPI
The formula for calculating the CPI is:

$CPI = \frac{\Sigma (P_c \cdot Q_b)}{\Sigma (P_b \cdot Q_b)} \cdot 100\%$

Where $P_c$ is the current price, $P_b$ is the base year price, and $Q_b$ is the quantity of the good/service. 

In other words, the CPI is the **ratio** of the cost of the market basket in the current year to the cost of the market basket in the base year times 100\%.

## Inflation Rate
The formula for calculating the inflation rate is:

$\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\text{CPI}_{\text{c}} - \text{CPI}_{\text{b}}}{\text{CPI}_{\text{b}}} \cdot 100\%$

## Main Idea: What is the difference between the CPI and the GDP deflator?
The **CPI** inflator is for *consumers*, while the **GDP** deflator is for *producers*.

# The Business Cycle (02/02)

![The Business Cycle](img/business-cycle.png){width=100%}

# Who Is Hurt/Benefits from (Unanticipated) Inflation? (02/05)
Technically, normal inflation is fine. That's because normal inflation is expected and accounted for in the market. Unanticipated inflation is the problem.

## How to know who is hurt/helped by inflation ($\pi$)
### If $\text{Actual } π > \text{Expected } \pi$:
- **Creditors/Lenders** are *hurt* because they loan money at a **fixed rate** based on the expected interest rate and will therefore receive less than if they based it off of the actual interest rate
- **Savers** are *hurt* because their savings have less purchasing power
- **Consumers with fixed incomes** are *hurt* because they can only buy less with their fixed income 
- **Borrowers/Debtors** are *helped* because they pay back their loans with money that has less purchasing power than when they borrowed it
- **Firms with small resource costs** are *helped* because product prices are rising faster than the costs of production, increasing their total revenue

### If $\text{Actual } \pi > \text{Expected } \pi$
Flip the above statements.

### Groups unaffected by inflation
- Workers that have a **cost-of-living adjustment** (COLA) in their contracts (typically union workers)
  - **Social Security** *does* have a COLA, but it's fairly minimal and not always enough to keep up with inflation.
- Pretty much anything else with an **adjustable rate**

## How to Calculate Real Income from Inflation:
- $\text{Real Income} = \frac{\text{Nominal Income}}{\text{CPI}}\cdot 100$
- $\% \Delta \text{Real Wage} = \% \Delta \text{Nominal Wage} - \% \Delta \text{CPI}$

## Why does inflation happen?
There are three main theories to explain inflation:

### Quantity Theory
- An increase in the supply of money drives prices up
- This causes the value of currency to decrease and prices to rise by the same magnitude
  - For example, if the value of the dollar decreases by 50%, prices will double to compensate, yielding 100% inflation
- This theory can easily lead to hyperinflation ($\pi \ge 200\%$ in < 1 yr.) if the money supply is increased too much

### Demand-Pull Theory
- A spike in consumerism causes an increase in demand for goods and services, which causes prices to rise
- Very common around the holiday season or Black Friday

### Cost-Push Theory
- Increased resource costs in the factor market causes firms to scale back production and raise prices
- The **wage-price spiral** is a common example of cost-push inflation
  - Workers demand higher wages to keep up with inflation, which causes firms to raise prices, which causes workers to demand higher wages, and so on
- Can also be caused by an overall decrease in the supply of resources because of a natural disaster or war
