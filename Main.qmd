# Types of Goods (01/08)

## Characteristics of the Four Types of Goods
- **Rivalrous** goods are those that can only be consumed by one person at a time. 
- **Non-rivalrous** goods are those that can be consumed by multiple people at the same time.
- **Excludable** goods are those that can be restricted to certain people.
- **Non-excludable** goods are those that cannot be restricted to certain people.
- If a public good is overcrowded enough, it can become a common resource

# Introduction to Externalities (01/09)
- An **externality** is a cost/benefit that affects a *third party* who did not choose to incur that cost/benefit.
- They are a type of **market failure** because they are *not* accounted for in the price of the good/service.
- The DWL of positive externalities will point to the right and vice-versa for negative externalities.
  - It also always points to the social optimum quantity.

## Positive Externality in Consumption
![Positive Externality in Consumption](img/pos-cons.png){width=50%}

### Examples
- Consumption of education
- Consumption of health care
- Advertisement can lead to an increase of demand in the free market $\therefore MPB$ goes up and moves the market toward $MSB$.

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MSB = MPB+MEB$.
- $MPB = MSB$
- $MB > MSB$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
The external **benefits** can be internalized by **subsidizing** the product/service to the consumers of the good/service.

## Negative Externality in Consumption
![Negative Externality in Consumption](img/neg-cons.png){width=50%}

### Examples
- Smoking in public/passive smoking
- Pollution due to fossil fuels
- Playing loud music
- Discarding garbage in public places

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MSB = MPB-MEB$.
- $MPB = MSB$
- $MB < MSB$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
The external **costs** can be internalized by **imposing a tax** on the product/service to the consumers of the good/service.

## Positive Externality in Production
![Positive Externality in Production](img/pos-prod.png){width=50%}

### Examples 
- Companies invest in training/professional development of their employees.
- Firms invest in research and development (R&D).

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MSC = MPC-MEC$.
- $MPB = MSC$
- $MC > MSC$

### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
The external **benefits** can be internalized by **subsidizing** the product/service to the producers of the good/service.

## Negative Externality in Production
![Negative Externality in Production](img/neg-prod.png){width=50%}

### Examples
- Firms produce chemicals that cause pollution $\therefore$ local fisherman cannot catch fish.
- Construction of roads lead to change of landscape and parks
- Coal fired power plants

### Spillover Effect
- The spillover effect is $MSC = MPC+MEC$.
- $MPB = MSC$
- $MC < MSC$


### Internalizing the Spillover Effect
- The external **costs** can be internalized by **imposing a tax** on the product/service to the producers of the good/service.
- The government intervention will move the private market to **social optimum** where $MSB = MSC$.
